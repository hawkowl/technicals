Versioning
==========

**Tenet:**
Good APIs have versions.

**Tenet:**
Good URIs never change, so your version should be explicitly in the URI.

**Tenet:**
Utilising API URIs that don't specify a version will eventually cause unmaintained applications to break.

**Tenet:**
Good APIs should document what has changed between versions.
