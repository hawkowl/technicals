The HawkOwl Technicals
======================

**technical** (/ˈtɛknɪk(ə)l/), *noun*
    *...an article, or series of articles, which pertain to a subject that requires special knowledge to be understood.*

The Technicals are my attempt at writing a book, one useful technical subject at a time.

They do not intend to be an authoritive guide on anything in particular, but will eventually contain valuable information on the topics of **Twisted**, **Python**, **API design**, and other miscellany.
