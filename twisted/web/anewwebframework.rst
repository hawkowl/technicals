A New Web Framework Proposal
============================

Abstract
--------

Twisted Web, in my opinion, is not so much a web framework, but the building blocks you would create a web server *with*.
Outside of Twisted, there are several things which provide this web framework -- the Divmod tools, Klein, Cyclone -- but they are either complex, imperfect in implementation, or quite heavy-weight.
Learning from these past implementations, Twisted should provide a user-facing web framework.

Example Code
